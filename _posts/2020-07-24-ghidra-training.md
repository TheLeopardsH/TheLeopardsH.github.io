# Background / Catching Up

Over the last few months, those of you who follow my ramblings here have probably noticed a serious lack of content (4 months!). When I started this project I wanted to try to post something once a month and managed to stay true to that goal up until recently, hopefully, this post will explain why. Sometime in May, I was contacted by [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) to work on a course for their [Hackaday-U](https://hackaday.io/u/) program, which is a program designed to offer **free** training and courses regarding all things technology. I like what Hackaday is doing with Hackaday-U and have been a long time Hackaday fan so this was something that I wanted to pursue. I  spent the majority of the early days of my career pouring over free materials that people had posted online and wanted to give back to a community that has helped me learn so much over the years. A site that comes to mind is [opensecuritytraining.info](http://opensecuritytraining.info/) - I learned so much from that site and if you've not looked at it before, definitely check it out! Lastly - if this training sounds interesting to you and you would like to take a more advanced private course, check out [VoidStar](https://www.voidstarsec.com/training) where I offer training based on a lot of the topics you've seen on this site!
